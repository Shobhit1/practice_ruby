# Learning Ruby the hard way - example 1

# puts "Hello World"
# puts "Hell Again"
# puts "I like typing this"
# puts "This is fun."
# puts "Yay! Printing."
# puts "I'd much rather you 'not'"
# puts "I \"said\" do not touch this"
# puts "I am trying to learn fucking ruby. I need this."

# Example two - Learning ruby the hard way

# A Comment, this is so you can read your program later
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out the piece of code
# puts "This won't run"

puts "This will run."
